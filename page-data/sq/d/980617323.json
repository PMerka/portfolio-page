This project uses a simple fractal tree algorithm to generate highly complex snowflake-like structures. The effect is highlighted by an overlap of lines with different opacity. The challenging part of this project was splitting the long-running algorithm into smaller tasks to prevent the freezing of the user interface.</p>","frontmatter":{"keywords":"Math, Fractal","title":"Fractal snowflake"}},{"html":"<p>This interactive application is also focused on snowflakes shapes, but the algorithm is much more similar to the natural formation of snow crystal. The core of this project lies in the implementation of a cellular automaton with hexagonal cell. The final snowflake shape is controled by simple rules mimicking water diffusion to crystallisation nucleus.</p>","frontmatter":{"keywords":"Physics simulation, Cellular-automaton, Crystal growth, Complex-system","title":"Simulation of snowflake growth"}},{"html":"<p>This app implements the simulation of collective behaviour known as boids. The program simulates movement typical for flocks of birds. The complex behaviour of boids is result of simple rules: separation, attraction and alignment of velocity vectors. Program logic and vector math is implemented with plain JS, the UI is created in react.</p>","frontmatter":{"keywords":"Complex system, Simulation of biological system","title":"Boids"}}]}}}
