This app implements the simulation of colective behaviour known as boids. The program simulates movement typical for flocks of birds. The colmplex behaviour of boids is result of simple rules: separation, atraction and alignment of velocity vectors. Program logic and vector math is implemanted with plain JS, the UI is created in react.
