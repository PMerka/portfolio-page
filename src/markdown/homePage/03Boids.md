This app implements the simulation of collective behaviour known as boids. The program simulates movement typical for flocks of birds. The complex behaviour of boids is result of simple rules: separation, attraction and alignment of velocity vectors. Program logic and vector math is implemented with plain JS, the UI is created in react.
