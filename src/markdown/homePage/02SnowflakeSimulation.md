This interactive application is also focused on snowflakes shapes, but the algorithm is much more similar to the natural formation of snow crystal. The core of this project lies in the implementation of a cellular automaton with hexagonal cell. The final snowflake shape is controlled by simple rules mimicking water diffusion to crystallisation nucleus.
