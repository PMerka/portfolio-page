Fractals are one of the most beautiful complex geometrical shapes. This project uses a simple fractal tree algorithm to generate highly complex snowflake-like structures. The effect is highlighted by an overlap of lines with different opacity. The challenging part of this project was splitting the long-running algorithm into smaller tasks to prevent the freezing of the user interface.
